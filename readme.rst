Official implementation of several experiments in the paper `"**Π-nets: Deep Polynomial Neural Networks**" <https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Chrysos_P-nets_Deep_Polynomial_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf>`_ (CVPR'20) and its `extension <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9353253>`_ (T-PAMI'21; also available `here <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13026>`_ ).

Each folder contains a different experiment. Please follow the instructions 
in the respective folder on how to run the experiments and reproduce the results. 
`This repository <https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets>`_ contains implementations in `MXNet <https://mxnet.apache.org/>`_, `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `Chainer <https://chainer.org/>`_.



Browsing the experiments
========================
The folder structure is the following:

*    ``face_recognition``: The folder contains the code for the `face verification and identification experiments <https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets/tree/master/face_recognition>`_.

*    ``image_generation_chainer``: The folder  contains the `image generation experiment on Chainer <https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets/tree/master/image_generation_chainer>`_; specifically the experiment without activation functions between the layers.

*    ``image_generation_pytorch``: The folder contains the `image generation experiment on PyTorch <https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets/tree/master/image_generation_pytorch>`_; specifically the conversion of a DCGAN-like generator into a polynomial generator.

*    ``mesh_pi_nets``: The folder contains the code for `mesh representation learning <https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets/tree/master/mesh_pi_nets>`_ with polynomial networks.

*    ``classification-NO-activation-function``: The folder contains the code for Π-nets without activation functions on classification (e.g. ImageNet). 




More information on Π-nets
==========================


A one-minute pitch of the paper is uploaded `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HmFSoU2cOw>`_. We describe there what generation results can be obtained even without activation functions between the layers of the generator. 

Π-nets do not rely on a single architecture, but enable diverse architectures to be built; the architecture is defined by the form of the recursive formula that constructs it. For instance, we visualize below two different Π-net architectures.

Results
=======

The evaluation in the paper [1]_ suggests that Π-nets can improve state-of-the-art methods. Below, we visualize results in image generation and errors in mesh representation learning.

The image above shows synthesizes faces. The generator is a Π-net, and more specifically a product of polynomials.

Color coded results of the per vertex reconstruction error on an exemplary human body mesh. From left to right: ground truth mesh, first order SpiralGNN, second, third and fourth order base polynomial in Π-nets. Dark colors depict a larger error; notice that the (upper and lower) limbs have larger error with first order SpiralGNN.
